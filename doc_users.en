INTRODUCTION
============

MPI is a standard in HPC community which allows a simple use of clusters. Nowoaday, there are several implementation (OpenMPI, BullxMPI, MPT, IntelMPI,MPC, ...) each of which involves a specific ABI (Application Binary Interface) for an application compiled with a specific MPI implementation.
With wi4mpi the ABI doesn't matter anymore. In fact, wi4mpi is a software allowing an ABI translation from an MPI implementation MPI1 to a MPI implementation MPI2, meaning that an application compiled with an MPI1 MPI implementation can now be run with a MPI2 implementation without re-compliation.

INSTALL
=======

The installation procedureis simply consists of a make clean all install sequence.

There are two different installations for wi4mpi encompassing the two different ways to use the software. Both are discussed in the next part (How to use wi4mpi):
   - The preload version
   - The interface version


Preload version:
----------------
First make sure you got an OpenMPI loaded in your environment, otherwise the IntelMPI --> OpenMPI conversion will not be performed correctly. 

Explanation

For such a conversion wi4mpi need to export the ompi_mpi_... symbols for a perfect execution. Otherwise some undefined symbol errors will be triggered.

End explanation

To compil the source code go to scr directory then use the following comands:

 - make clean
 - make all -j 4
 - make install (be careful, by default the program is installed in /usr/local) 
In order to change the install directory please use the prefix variable as follow:

 - make prefix=... install

The install directory should now contain the following file:

- bin/wi4mpi 
- etc/wi4mpi.cfg 
- libexec/wi4mpi/ **Directory which contain all the library allowing the translation**
- libexec/wi4mpi/fakelibINTEL/ **Directory which contain all the empty library called for an INTEL_OMPI conversion**
- libexec/wi4mpi/fakelibOMPI/ **Directory which contain all the empty library called for an OMPI_INTEL conversion**
- libexec/wi4mpi/fakelibCXX/ **Directory which contain the empty c++ library in order to avoid some issues when link is done via mpicxx**


Interface version:
------------------

To compile this version go to the wi4mpi-1.1.0/test_cccmpi_cc/src/ and use the following commands:

 - make clean
 - make all -j 4
 - make install (be careful, by default the program is installed in /usr/local) 
In order to change the install directory please use the prefix variable as follow:

 - make prefix=... install

The install directory should now contain the following file:

 - bin : contain all the wrapper mpi
 - include : contain all the necessary include to compile an mpi application
 - lib : contain the library which an MPI application is link with
 - lib_IMPI : contain the library which perform the ABI translation between our ABI and the IntelMPI ABI
 - lib_OMPI : contain the library which perform the ABI translation between our ABI and the OpenMPI ABI


How to use wi4mpi
=================

As mentionned in the previous section, there are two different ways to use our library.
The first way is to use the preload version which allowed any MPI application to be run with a different MPI implementation than the one used for the compilation without a re-compilation process.
We currently support 4 conversions :
   - OpenMPI --> OpenMPI
   - OpenMPI --> IntelMPI
   - IntelMPI --> IntelMPI
   - IntelMPI --> OpenMPI
To do so, some environment variables have to be set first.

- OpenMPI --> OpenMPI :
   
   export TRUE_MPI_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi.so"
   export TRUE_MPI_F_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi_mpifh.so"   
   export LD_PRELOAD="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/libwi4mpi_OMPI_OMPI.so $TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $TRUE_MPI_LIB"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibCXX:$PATH"

- OpenMPI --> IntelMPI

   export TRUE_MPI_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpi.so"
   export TRUE_MPI_F_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpifort.so"
   export LD_PRELOAD="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/libwi4mpi_OMPI_INTEL.so $TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $TRUE_MPI_LIB"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibCXX:path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibOMPI:$PATH"

- IntelMPI --> IntelMPI
   
   export TRUE_MPI_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpi.so"
   export TRUE_MPI_F_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpifort.so"
   export LD_PRELOAD="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/libwi4mpi_INTEL_INTEL.so $TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $TRUE_MPI_LIB"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibCXX:$PATH"

- IntelMPI --> OpenMPI

   export TRUE_MPI_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi.so"
   export TRUE_MPI_F_LIB="$env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi_mpifh.so"
   export LD_PRELOAD="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/libwi4mpi_OMPI_INTEL.so $TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $TRUE_MPI_LIB"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibCXX:path_to_wi4mpi_install/libexec/fakelibINTEL:$PATH"
For each conversion, the first MPI implementation points the implementation used for the compilation, and the second one indicate the implementation selected for execution.
At the TGCC ( TrÃ¨s Grand Centre de Calcul du CEA) we used a module environment with a flavor system allowing a simple way to switch between all the available conversion.
The protocol works as follow for both version 1.0.3 and 1.0.4.

module load wi4mpi/1.0.3 : load the module and the default flavor flavor/wi4mpi/openmpi.
The flavor indicates the MPI implementation used for the compilation of the application
module load mpi/openmpi/1.8.8 : The module MPI currently loaded in the environment selects the runtime to be used.


The second way we mentionned is to use the interface, only  available with the last version 1.1.0 of wi4mpi. The purpose of this interface is to compile any application with it, and then change the MPI implementation used for the execution without any process of compilation. So wi4mpi translate the interface ABI (named CCC) to the MPI implementation ABI used to be run.
To do so, some environment variables have to be set as follow:


 - export CCC_LIBMPI_ROOT="/path_to_wi4mpi_install_root"
 - export CCC_LIBMPICC=icc
 - export CCC_MPIFC=ifort
 - export CCC_MPICXX=icpc
 
 - CCC --> IntelMPI
   
   setenv TRUE_MPI_LIB $env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpi.so
   setenv TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $env(MPI_ROOT)/lib64/libmpifort.so
   setenv WRAPPER_WI4MPI $env(CCC_LIBMPI_ROOT)/lib_IMPI/libwi4mpi_CCC_INTEL.so
   

 - CCC --> OpenMPI

   setenv TRUE_MPI_LIB $env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi.so
   setenv TRUE_MPI_F_LIB $env(MPI_ROOT)/lib/libmpi_mpifh.so
   setenv WRAPPER_WI4MPI $env(CCC_LIBMPI_ROOT)/lib_OMPI/libwi4mpi_CCC_OMPI.so

Once again this solution has been set up at the TGCC with the module environment.
module load wi4mpi/1.1.0 : load the module and the default flavor flavor/wi4mpi/openmpi.
The flavor indicate the MPI implementation used for the execution, and the corresponding module is automatically loaded. 


Developers words
================

First of all thanks a lot for using the wi4mpi software. Nevertheless be aware that this software is still under development and that some bugs may remain. If you encounter one of them, don't hesitate to contact one of the authors and so to participate to the software robustness.
Second, wi4mpi is compatible with the 1.3 MPI norm and MPI-IO. Wi4mpi should be MPI 3.1 compliant before January 2017
And finally, an wi4mpi open source should be soon release. Don't hesitate to participate :-)
